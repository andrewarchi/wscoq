# wspace-coq

wspace-coq is an interpreter for the Whitespace programming language, written in
Coq.

## Resources

Inspired by [WS-idr](https://github.com/edwinb/WS-idr), a Whitespace interpreter
in Idris made by Edwin Brady, the creator of Idris and Whitespace. If it can be
done in Idris, it can be done in Coq. (See [wspace/edwinb-ws-idr](https://github.com/wspace/edwinb-ws-idr)
for an updated fork.)
